/**
 * 
 * A lambda expression can be used when ever type is a functional interface
 * 		- This is a single abstract method type.
 * 		- The lambda expression provide the implementation of the abstract method. 
 * 
 * Functional interface :
 * 
 * An interface can have more than one default method 
 * An interface should have only one static method
 * Method inherited from object class doesn't count
 * An interface have only on abstract method
 *  [static and default are not counter since it is associated the implementation]
 *  
 *  Category:
 *  
 *  1. Consumer
 *  2. Supplier
 *  3. Function
 *  4. Predicate
 *  5. UniaryOperator
 *  6. BinaryOperator
